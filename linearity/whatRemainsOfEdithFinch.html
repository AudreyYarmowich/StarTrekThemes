        <h3>What remains of Edith Finch</h3>
        <p class="w3-opacity">linearity</p>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        
        <p>This is an interactive movie where you act as the main character Edith Finch, revisiting your childhood house as the last member of the Finch family. Each of the family members dies young. Rumors say there’s a curse with Finch. </p>
        <p>Story begins when you reentering the abandoned Finch house. Everything happened at the night when you left shows as you walk around. Even the food containers stay at the same place. Most of the rooms are locked. You as a kid often look through the peephole in the same way as looking at an oil painting.         </p>
        <p>Complicated puzzles are built with the house. After solving several of them, you entered Molly’s room. She’s of your grandma’s age, yet passes away at 10. The diary on her desk recorded her last day’s adventure. She was sent to bed without dinner, so she wandered around and ate everything she could eat - hampster’s food, toothpaste and poisonous berries on decoration. She became a starving cat chasing a bird, and then a hawk chasing rabbits, and then a shark craving for seals, then a monster eating humans. The monster she became went back to her bedroom and attempt to eat her. “I am delicious.” The last sentence of Molly’s diary is naive yet disturbing.         </p>
        <p>The next is Barbara, a child star who died at a teenger when giving her last perfomance on a Halloween party. The story was in a manga book. Then it’s Calvin who dreamed of becoming an astronaut and decreased when playing on a swing. And so on and so on. The flashbacks of each character become closer and closer to now, until reality and folklores blend. The whole experience is a collection of bizarre tales of the Finch. At the last, the perspective switched to Edith’s kid, retelling his mother Edith’s death. And the curse continues. 
        </p>

        <h4>Gameplay</h4>
        <iframe width=100% height = 560px src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G9B15cptgq0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <p>Similar to If on a winter’s night a traveler, What remains of Edith Finch is a story of searching for stories. In If on a winter’s night a traveler, the contents of the books “you” (the reader) are searching for was vague and unrelated to “your” real life. As “you” hunt for the real book, “you” yourself gets closer and closer to the stories. The ending of your journey is a seemingly good ending for another story where you, the reader, is the author and main character. In If on a winter’s night a traveler, you can barely find the distance between you and the character. The author is trying to engaging you in the experience by interacting with you through pages- he describes the most unnoticeable micro behaviors when you read. “How did he know what I am doing?” When reading the book, this question came to my mind several times, and it was kind of disturbing. The author managed to break the fourth wall between us and the characters in story.
        </p>
        <p>In What remains of Edith Finch, the same trick displays. You, Edith FInch, was the detective for your family history. By the end of the journey, you are another victim of Finch's ongoing curse. The experience from a reader to a main character, from a witness to a victim, is surreal and shocking. The fragmented style of storytelling, and the switch of roles, contributes to the postmodernism element of the game. The player or audience’s belief about life and literature is challenged as the game proceeds. It also builds a paranoia of narrators of different eras within the family history of the Finch. 
        </p>
        <p>Similar technique is used in One Hundred years of Solitude. Repeated cycle of Jose and Aureliano, ongoing family curse of tragic ending. The family history runs parallel to the history of South America. In the end, the magic ancient prophecies left by Melquíades are decoded. The mystery they try to solve for decades turns out to be the family history of their own. By the end, the legend and reality in the book miraculously overlapped.
        </p>
        <p>Another feature of What remains of Edith Finch is  the unreliable narration. In the first round of gameplay, the player might not notice how bizarre those stories of the Finch’s deaths are. In the second walkthrough, I noticed the apparent logical discrepancy between the reality in the house, and the story in Edith’s mind. In the letter recording Calvin’s life (death) story, I paused and observed the contents on the paper. It didn’t mention anything about Calvin wants to fly from a swing. Also in Gregory’s story, he becomes a frog and dives into the drain of the tub. I deduced this part might be based on Edith’s imagination as well. There are theories about the possibility of mental illness among the Finch family. Edith’s first person perspective narration is unreliable. In Molloy and the Women Warriors, unreliable narration plays an important role in storytelling. What actually happened ceases to matter. The message from the author is the way of narration. Extragging by retelling the story in a magical realism way allows the audience to think: in the aimless journey of Molloy, where is the end? Is Molloy and Moran the same person from 2 ends of the storyline? After several rounds of gameplay, what remains for us players, is powerlessness towards destiny. </p>
