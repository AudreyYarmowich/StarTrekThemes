        <h4>Summary</h4>
        
        <p>In the summer before Okabe’s college starts, he sits in his lab with his “lab members”. It’s not really a lab, just an apartment shared by a geek, a girl and you. Everything seems to be normal until you see a girl dies before you. And the next moment, she’s talking in an essay review meeting. </p>
        <p>Somehow you persuaded the girl, a genius neurosciencist to join your lab. And by accident, you guys create a time machine with  a microwave, a TV and a phone. The pace of the game is slow. And the only mode of interaction is the phone. Sometimes it will be a phone call, sometimes texting. By responding to it differently, the story will proceed to different worldline. At the beginning, everything seems great. You predicted the number of a lottery, helped your friend who lost her father to save her dad, switched the gender of Suzuha. </p>
        <p>Yet the cycle begins. Mayuri, your childhood friend, died in an accident. With the time machine, you could save her, so you jumped back in time again and again, only to find her dying in different ways. This part of the game is long and depressing. There’s simply nothing you can do to save her. The true ending is like in this very complicated graph. </p>

        <h4>Gameplay</h4>

        <h4>Game Graph</h4>
        
        <iframe src="steinsgate-flowchart1.pdf" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <p>Steins;Gate is different from traditional galgames which have given number of possible endings for each main girl character. The only option in the game is answer the phone call or not. This situation is similar to Molloy when he proceeds for an unknown goal. </p>
        <p>The main character, Hoouin Kyouma, after inventing a time machine by accident, is urged by the wish of people surrounding him to make changes to their past and improve their current condition. He has no knowledge of what will possible be caused by his each decision. The uncertainty of what happens after taking each action is unclear to Kyouma, although he’s clearly aware of making such decisions. Molloy is also making decisions based only on his present knowledge, without knowing the pass experience or possible outcome in the future. A setting of this game reinforced the state of “unawareness”. </p>
        <p>Every time after worldline changes, everyone will live based on the past happened in this worldline, while Kyouma is the only one perceiving the changes. However minor the changes are, the outcome is totally different. At this moment, Kyouma can’t tell which one is the reality to him. </p>
        <p>Things get even worse after the sudden death of Mayuri occurred. Shot by the spies, pushed down the rail platform, died in riot accident, crushed by a car, Mayuri won’t survive after a certain time no matter how Kyouma tries to save her. The destined fate and powerlessness seized Kyouma. Such desperation is the basic impression of postmodernism. Everything is determined and is not possible for individual to change with their own efforts. </p>
        <p>In Molloy, the detective Moran made every decision in order to improve his condition, yet these decisions are dragging him to the hell. Molloy seeks to find his mother, who no longer exists in the world at the very beginning of his journey. Such powerlessness goes through the whole game, and proceed to its serial work, Steins;Gate 0.</p>
