      Since Assimov’s introduction of the <a href="">three laws of robotics </a> to science fiction in 1942, science fiction has played with the themes of artificial servitude and artificial intelligence as both explorations of what is possible and the social and political issues that would arise with robotics. In the 1960s, as popular culture focused on the Cold War, the possibility of nuclear holocaust, and the mutually assured destruction of the major powers, Star Treks portrayed robots more as mindless tools and weapons. But as the world progressed and computer/robotic technology advanced, questions of the free will and morality with artificial intelligence comes up more and more. The Next Generation plays on this trope by replacing the “robot like” <a href="">Commander Spock </a> with the actual robot <a href="">Lieutenant-Commander Data</a>. Questions of Data’s sentience recur throughout the show as he tries to become more human, gaining emotions, the ability to laugh, and the desire to reproduce. Now a days with intelligent assistants in arms length at all time mimicking sentience, the only novem left in robotics is pure sentience and the ability to perfectly mimic/replace humanity. The series of Star Trek Picard focuses its entire first season on these issues, even replacing the word robot or AI with “Synthetic lifeform” which is used throughout the show.

      In Star Trek: The Original Series, robots build ships, serve, and destroy as weapons of war but there is no reasoning with a robot, just as there is no reasoning with a wrench or hammer. There can be no questions of morality as the idea of a living robot is not even a possibility. And even when the Enterprise does meet artificial beings in season 1 episode 9 <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/What_Are_Little_Girls_Made_Of%3F_(episode)">“What Are Little Girls Made Of”</a>, the conflict is not a moral issue but a practical one. The robots do not worry about the death of a human and have no value of life, no emotional connections, and only obey orders even if they look like people. And in the end, <a href="">Captain Kirk</a> uses the limits of computer programming to outwit the robots and escape. We see this inanimacy again, in <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Doomsday_Machine_(episode)">“The Doomsday Machine”</a> Kirk learns of a robot so fierce and destructive it will devour planets for fuel and is unstoppable. When <a href="">Captain Picard</a> encounters the similarly themed Crystalline Entity in season 5 episode 4 <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Silicon_Avatar_(episode)">“Silicon Avatar”</a>, the captain attempts to contact it, attempts to study it further, researches its past destruction (They bring in an expert who has been studying the entity her whole life), and finally he tries to save it from Star Fleets mandate to destroy it on moral grounds. In “The Doomsday Machine,” Kirk never tries to reason with it and just assumes its nature as a weapon. It is never hailed and there is no question that it needs to be destroyed.

        But in The Next Generation, robots are viewed more as diet-humans. Jokes are made about Data’s lack of humanity; he is clearly different, robotic, and is treated subhuman at times. But Data is not just a comic relief character. He grows and develops. In <a href="">“The Measure of A Man”</a> there is the stark contrast of Picard referring to Data using the pronouns he/him while Bruce Maddox refers to Data as it/its. But it is when  Guinan introduces the moral implications of creating a servant class, that Picard realized that unless they could be 100% sure that Data is not sentient, then the court will be "savagely curtailing" his rights which would violate the very principles of The Federation they are attempting to uphold. A far stretch from The Federation of TOS which didn't even consider to hail the assumed Doomsday Machine and who treated androids as disposable automatons. In the end, Data is legally declared to not be a human, but not property either and is given the freedom to explore that aspect for himself. And throughout the series he does explore: writing poetry, caring for a pet cat, painting, and reading fiction (especially Sherlock Holmes). Data’s quest even ends up with him turning down becoming human or at least more human twice, first when offered by Q in “TNG: Hide and Q” and later when offered by The Borg Queen in “Star Trek: First Contact.” This much more nuanced notion of intellegence plays into the Star Trek of the 80s and 90s, inspiring first Professor Moriarty (later in TNG), then The Doctor in Star Trek: Voyager, and finally Vic Fontaine in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine; all holograms powered by computers that respond, learn, and are self aware to the point of sentience.
