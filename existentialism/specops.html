        <h2>Walker's Inferno</h2>
        <h3>How Spec Ops: The Line Interacts with Sartre's Existentialism</h3>
        <p class="w3-opacity">By James Johnson</p>
        <p>At its core, Spec Ops: The Line is the story of a man facing an existential crisis as he slowly descends into Hell. Faced with the horrors that his decisions have brought upon the world, Walker realizes that he is an evil man and has to decide how to live with that fact. On top of this narrative, is another one about choice and freedom that paints a bleak picture reminiscent of Harvey Dent in Nolan’s The Dark Knight.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Spec Ops: The Line initially presents itself as a standard military shooter where the player controls a special forces officer that is sent in to a bad situation to save the day. This preconception of what the game is going to be starts to change on the title screen as subtle imagery paints a very different picture. Dubai is pictured as a destroyed city with imagery that would fit just as well in a game like The Last of Us or Fallout as the player character sits overlooking the city from a skyscraper next to a tattered American flag flying upside down. This is not a situation where the player is trying to save the day. That point is long gone at this point; all that’s left to do is pick up the pieces and try to minimize losses. The upside down flag also implies that the player character will struggle to keep themselves alive as an upside down flag implies the protagonist is in a situation of extreme distress.</p>
        <p>Walker, the player character of the game, begins his descent into madness and Hell in the first act of the game with a helicopter crash. While fending off enemies, the helicopter suddenly crashes and the screen cuts to black. Questions like did Walker survive, did he get injured, or where do we go from here are left unanswered as the game cuts to earlier in the timeline when Walker was first sent into Dubai to help out the 33rd infantry battalion who were there to help out locals after massive sandstorms attacked the city. Before Walker and his squad can help the 33rd battalion, they must fight through a local militia group that has been trying to take control of the dwindling water supply for themselves.</p>
        <p>The player first questions the nature of the game when a complex situation leads the player to start firing upon and killing US troops. The 33rd battalion is seen rounding up refugees for what appears to be much less than altruistic purposes and Walker decides to intervene and ends up in a firefight with the 33rd and the refugees. The actions the player is forced to take make them uneasy and require at least a cursory internal debate on the morality of the situation. Taking a step back and really considering the situation leads one to question what makes firing upon the Dubai citizens who are just trying to defend themselves and their water supply different from firing upon American soldiers who are acting against the people they are supposed to be protecting. Either way, the player is left between a rock and a hard place where intervening means killing innocents and Americans and doing nothing means leaving people to suffer at the hands of the American military.</p>
        <p>The true horror of Spec Ops: The Line comes when Walker and his squad become pinned down by the 33rd with seemingly no way to advance. The only way out is for Walker to use white phosphorous to clear the area. Walker is ardently against using white phosphorous as it is a very deadly and dangerous chemical weapon whose use has been banned in any situation where there is a possibility of it affecting civilians and is in a legal gray area for its use as a weapon (as opposed be used as an illumination tool). If the player agrees with Walker’s abhorrence of white phosphorous they can attempt to shoot their way out of the situation. However, this path can only end with the player’s death as they eventually run out of ammunition and ways to fight back. The only way for the player to proceed through the game is to use the white phosphorous and then find out that they accidentally killed 47 civilians as they walk among their disfigured corpses.</p>
        <p>Online discussion of the game (such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dzstxE_5Rc">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tULRgsc362o&t=634s">here</a>) questions why the developers would force the player to take such horrific action as committing a war crime without having any other option that can be chosen. However, the lack of choice is merely a surface level interpretation of the options offered by the game. From Sartre’s idea of radical freedom, the actual choice offered is between using the white phosphorous and not playing the game at all. The main point of Spec Ops: The Line is that Walker, like the player, was willing to keep on committing atrocities and war crimes. No one is forcing the player to keep playing the game and Walker had every opportunity to back out of Dubai as he was ordered to early on in the game. The developers are simply equating the player continuing to play the game with Walker plowing headstrong into a situation he has no chance of improving. Like Harvey Dent in The Dark Knight, the player’s options are to die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.</p>

        <p>After Walker uses the white phosphorous, he continues to commit acts of violence that range from morally gray to outright atrocities as he continues to pursue the elusive leader of the 33rd battalion. This eventually leads him to enter a facsimile of Hell as all of Dubai is wreathed in flames and the in game version of the Burj Khalifa is transformed into a tower that even Sauron would envy. Walker reaches the tower and is finally able to confront Conrad: the man he has been chasing after the whole game. The man that Walker has used as a justification for all of his sins and crimes. All that Walker finds is a rotting corpse that was once Conrad. The mysterious man behind the radio was just a hallucination that Walker used to justify his actions.</p>
        <p>Faced with the truth of the matter, Walker realizes that he has become everything that he has fought against and enters an existential crisis as he must decide how to deal with the internal strife. The choice given to the player is to kill Walker allowing him to live authentically by fighting against evil or to continue on in his imaginary world where Conrad is still alive and change his essence to something completely different. I expect that there is no right or wrong choice as everything depends on what kind of person the player and Walker are. The point of the choice is not to see if the right choice is made but to force the player to ask themselves what living authentically means and to make the choice that most aligns with how that question is answered.</p>
        <p>Spec Ops: The Line forces players to confront the same difficult questions that Sartre grapples with in Existentialism. While the game appears to be just a generic military shooter continuing on in the Spec Ops franchise, any player that really engages with the game will be unable to complete it without understanding existentialism just a little bit better. Spec Ops: The Line is an existentialist thought experiment brought to life and packaged as a fun mainstream video game.</p>
