            <center><p class="w3-opacity">Portrait of Yoko Taro from GameInformer</p></center>
            <p>Yoko Taro is an unusual figure in the gaming industry, as not only do all his works share a singular and somewhat convoluted canon, but that the themes and ideas he explores are recognizably his own. Indeed, he is somewhat more of an artist or director than a game developer, taking into full consideration the unique expressive power of video games and leveraging it to tell stories that would have otherwise been impossible to convey through a traditional non-interactive medium. Nier Automata is a post-modern game in the truest sense of the word. Its narrative is deliberately non-linear, requiring the player to finish several play-throughs from different character perspectives to fully understand. Its gameplay bridges the gap between several different genres, switching from third person spectacle fighter to classic role-playing game to twin-stick shooter to bullet hell. The player is made immediately aware of its tendencies to break the fourth wall within the first few minutes of starting the game, as the deuteragonist 9S directly instructs the player to adjust the game settings to their liking. Indeed, even the names of our playable characters themselves reference Shakespeare and hint at the game’s themes, 2B – “To be or not to be” and A2 – “Et tū, Brūte? (you too, Brutus?)”. He also deliberately shies away from public attention and prefers to attend in-person events wearing a Nier mask. </p>            
            
            <center><h2>Nier's Existential World</h2></center>
            <center><img src="./nier2bandmachine.jpg" alt="nier2bandmachine.jpg" style="width:90%"></center>
            <center><p class="w3-opacity">A screenshot of 2B and a Machine (The Gamer)</p></center>
            <p>As is common for many Japanese games, the opening quotation by our player character, in this case being 2B, alludes to the killing of god and resulting freedom from predestination with “is this curse, or some kind of punishment, I often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle, and wonder if we'll ever have the chance to kill him”. In a very literal sense according to the history of Nier Automata’s universe, the answer appears to be a resounding no. The world that 2B, 9S and A2 inhabit is one of endless and eternal proxy war fought between humanity and an invading alien force by their creations, the androids and the machines. The former is represented by the elegant, human-like and graceful androids led by the Yorha organization, whereas the latter is represented by retro-futuristic, clunky and primitive blocky machines which share a sort of collective information network. As the player eventually learns, both progenitor races are now extinct and have “become as gods”, objects of worship and the focus of each creation races’ ideology. Humanity perished several thousand years before the advent of the android-machine war due to a plague, and the alien invaders were murdered by their own creations. To the extant parties, they may never kill god (again, for the machines) because god is already dead. In this manner, I find the sentiment of “existence precedes essence” to be maximally implemented. Though the androids and machines were built for war on behalf of their creators, which could be considered their essential nature, they are clearly capable of exercising free will, which when compounded with the players realization that their essential goal is unfulfillable due to the extinction of their creators, paints a world in which our characters are forced to confront the emptiness of their existences. </p>
            
            <center><h2>The Nature of Existence</h2></center>
            <p>The bodies of androids and machines house what we consider to be a consciousness or intelligence. This ability in both parties originates from alien technology, as the intelligent core of an android lies in its black box, made from parts of destroyed machines. Furthermore, androids and machines may backup, restore and transfer their consciousnesses through a centralized server, which is later revealed to be shared amongst both groups.  As 2B notes in the beginning, all artificial life forms are “perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death”. To them, existence preceding essence is not so much a philosophical claim but a literal reality, as any conception of individuality, self or meaning is necessarily devoid from physical forms, which can be destroyed, replaced, and duplicated at any time. This sentiment of existing beyond one’s physical existence and original purpose is explicitly shown several times. In one example, a non-player-character android refuses to replace a broken leg because it is the only part of his body which is original, and he fears that removing it would somehow degrade him. He is eventually persuaded to do so on the grounds that his soul or mind is what he is, not his body. The second example might be the ending of the first play-through, in which 2B asks 9S, in the body of a machine built to fight against the androids, if it truly is him, to which he responds, it is.  </p>            
            
            <center><h2>Facing a Godless World</h2></center>

            <center><p class="w3-opacity">The dead Alien creators of the Machines (Nier Wiki)</p></center>
            <p>Androids working under Yorha are told that the organization was established by humanity to act towards the fulfillment of its best interests and the defeat of the alien invaders. In reality, Yorha was created by an artificial intelligence working alongside androids after the extinction of mankind to give dispossessed and despairing androids a new purpose in life. Despite not being human, all androids including the player characters 9S, 2B and A2 consider servitude towards humanity to be their supreme and higher calling. Machines on the other hand having killed their alien creators at the order of the same artificial intelligence and realizing that they were doomed to an eternity of stagnation as their primitive hardware would never let them evolve further, sought to achieve enlightenment by imitating humanity and like the androids grasp at the divine and transcendental nature of human beings. Indeed, we learn that the android-machine war was in fact orchestrated by that same artificial intelligence in hopes of breeding, through conflict that is so characteristically human and the assimilation of human culture, a newly evolved type of being. Thus, it is in this universe in which machines and androids seek out human philosophies of the past to try and make sense of their present and decide for themselves, what their essence is and a new reason for being.  </p>
            
            <center><h2>Sartre, Pascal and Other Philosopher Machines</h2></center>

            <center><p class="w3-opacity">Kierkegaard's Cult</p></center>
            <p>Sartre appears in game as an unusual machine who lives in Pascal’s village of pacifist machines, Pascal being another philosopher machine who founded the village to escape from the horrors and futility of the android-machine war. Machine Sartre is much like his real-world counterpart in his philosophy, even muttering the exact phrase “existence precedes essence” to our player characters. However, certain personal qualities of Sartre have been exaggerated and magnified in machine Sartre. He is difficult to understand, alienating other pacifist machines who refer to his teachings as “mumbo-jumbo” excluding a small cult of devoted followers, and self-absorbed to the point of never engaging the player in actual conversation, preferring to monologue at them instead. Other historical philosophers who also appear as machines have their teachings similarly questioned.  </p>
            <p>Machine Simone de Bouveir’s performance of womanhood has no effect on a disinterested machine Sartre, a curious reversal of reality. Machine Pascal implements his eponymous wager only to scare his followers into suicide. Machine Kant, promising to create a kingdom of knightly virtue oriented around the categorically good imperative, is reborn after his death as a deaf and mute baby machine, never to explain how to implement this categorical imperative in practice. Machine Kierkegaard decides that the best way to grasp their immortal and permanent essence or soul would be to imitate their dead creators, to “become as gods”, and ends up as the head of a suicide cult. Each of these machines has a small country populated with unique machine non-player-characters dedicated to their individual teachings. The machine philosophers’ efforts, however, all lead to the eventual ruination of their respective kingdoms, except for the Sartre machine who inexplicably disappears for no clear reason but is hinted to have gone off in some lone journey for a transcendental truth. He is never seen from again. </p>
            <p>Philosophers from human history often tried to figure out themselves the higher purposes, meanings, and ethics behind existence, yet we have still failed to comprehensively answer the existential question from any of their proposed perspectives. As such, we the player are fully aware of the futility of the machines’ quest and know they are doomed to failure. </p>

            <center><h2>Critiquing Sartre</h2></center>
            <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6HjXGsmVkj8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
            <p>Sartre’s brand of existentialism, in addition to being subjectivist and valuing the uniqueness and importance of an individual’s experiences, was highly individualistic and came off as arrogant to many. He insisted that it was the duty of all man to not run from the existential dread of knowing that there is no divine pre-set meaning to existence and that simultaneously, any choice we make for ourselves conjures an image of man as he ought to be. Anyone who shirks from this responsibility, Sartre shows open disdain for in his writing, referring to them as cowards. Taro’s criticism of Existentialism takes two forms. The first, that Sartre’s unempathetic attitude towards those who struggle in the face of existential dread is unwarranted and only possible due to his relatively comfortable lifestyle. The second, that individualistic approaches at finding a universal essence will inevitably fail. The latter is implemented in the section above with the machine philosophers.  </p>

            <center><h2>Empathy Towards Strugglers</h2></center>
            <p>To understand Taro’s dissatisfaction at Sartre’s teachings, we must first understand the specifics of how inhabitants of Nier Automata’s world suffer and struggle upon realizing the truth that god is dead, as well as the grief borne from shouldering the responsibility of producing an image of a machine or android for all machines and androids. Our first example is 9S, a unique android that specializes in intelligence gathering rather than direct combat. Upon learning that humanity is extinct and that his partner 2B has died a slow and torturous death due to a random and unexpected infection by a virus (created by the governing artificial intelligence as yet another part of its plan to evolve artificial life), he is stricken by the senselessness and pointlessness of the suffering he once endured thinking he was working towards some higher end for humanity. 9S gradually goes insane having lost the will to go on and neglects the maintenance necessary for proper android function. </p>
            <p>Indeed, this condition is not unique to androids as shown by the clip attached below. </p>
            <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N_xQzTY1DF4?start=56" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
            <p>Though 2B and 9S, and everyone else, possess free will, they are subjected constantly to forces and machinations beyond their comprehension that have no regard for them as individuals, the governing artificial intelligence seeing them more as a means to an end than sentient beings with their own hopes and aspirations. They are repeatedly plunged into a profound despair regarding their inability to elevate themselves from the inevitability of misfortune and torment at the hands of and endless cyclical android-machine war. That 2B, 9S and the machines fail to find fulfillment and meaning in such conditions comes as no surprise to the player, is no fault of their own, and naturally invokes our deepest sympathies. </p>
            <p>As robot Sartre lectures our player characters who have suffered immensely in this godless world about how existence precedes essence and that they are free to make of reality what they choose, we the player are made keenly aware the nature of Taro’s critique. The individualist idealism that Sartre expounds to 2B and 9S invalidates their suffering and struggles, downplaying the truly horrific material and physical realities they live in. Furthermore, machine Sartre has lived in relatively peace and comfort at Pascal’s village his entire life, having never participated in direct combat. This is a likely allusion to Sartre’s involvement in World War 2 as a drafted meteorologist. Indeed, Taro’s understanding of existentialism is that it is only viable for those in positions of privilege, free from physical and material pain. The player intuitively understands why 2B and 9S show open disdain for Sartre’s teachings upon meeting him. </p>
            <p>Prescribing Existentialism to the androids and machines on the frontlines would be like Sartre himself lecturing to a blinded World War 2 veteran that the violence, pain and anguish he experienced is what he makes of it, and expecting his grief at losing his vision to be assuaged. For a more vivid picture, one might also imagine that Sartre would tell this veteran he would be a coward should he try to run away from his apparently individual responsibility to confront this torment.  </p>

            <center><h2>Taro's Ending</h2></center>
            <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-4BV4A35bQ?start=506" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

            <p>As the game draws to an end, the player finds themselves naturally dissatisfied at the state of affairs following the agonizing deaths of all three playable characters: 2B due to a virus that gradually degraded her physical form, 9S at the hands of systemic corruption to his black-box caused by his insanity, and A2 succumbing to her injuries after defeating 9S. Though the governing artificial intelligence that perpetuated the war has been defeated thanks to their efforts, it is clear to the player that the yearning for meaning in an empty godless world that caused over 14 cycles of android-machine war has not been addressed. It seems that the game’s ideology is overtly claiming that self-determination and self-actualization, to find ones’ essence, is impossible.  </p>
            <p>However, in a masterful act of subversion, we find Taro’s answer to this existential question and the answer to the opening quote in the credits scene. In this, the player must shoot down the names of the developers including Taro himself in a bullet hell sequence, in a literal sense killing the gods that created the cruel universe our beloved characters inhabit. This sequence is impossibly difficult, at least for any one person. As the intensity of the music swells, the number of developer names and projectiles the player must handle grows ever larger. Eventually, the player will die, and must restart the sequence. In this moment, we feel the same despair as characters in Nier Automata, fighting an impossible fight and repeating the same cycle with no idea what awaits us at the end. The player will become increasingly frustrated, like the characters themselves, at the tremendous difficulty of defeating god alone.  </p>
            <p>As if to add insult to injury, every time the player dies, they will be asked a prompt such as “are video games meaningless”. If at any time the player gives in and answers yes, the sequence ends, and they must restart. However, having endured almost forty hours of this game and seeing firsthand the depths of its existential themes, we disagree. The player, through the sunk cost fallacy or faith, feels that there must be some higher meaning to what we’re doing and presses on. Seeing the words of encouragement from other players who’ve suffered as you have, the player will be motivated to continue. On the third player death, assuming the player wished to continue, a new prompt will appear asking if the player would like help. We know that the fight is impossible as an individual, so we of course hit yes. Then, player names from all over the world appear on your screen and fly in formation with your ship, shielding you from danger and helping you defeat the creator gods of Nier. Every time you take damage, another player’s “data” is lost and their ship is destroyed. The player becomes aware of the music and how it is sung in a variety of different languages by a multi-national ensemble cast working together, with Taro himself participating in the chorus of the song which goes:  </p>

              <center><p class="w3-opacity">It's like I'm carrying the weight of the world</p></center>
              <center><p class="w3-opacity">I wish that someway, somehow</p></center>
              <center><p class="w3-opacity">That I could save every one of us</p></center>
              <center><p class="w3-opacity">But the truth is that I'm only one girl</p></center>
              
            <p>In this moment it becomes clear to the player what the answer was to the opening question and Taro’s feelings on confronting existential despair. Just as we escape the endless cycle of suffering in the credits scene through the help of other players where we failed to kill god alone, just as the machine philosophers and androids failed to find self-actualization and meaning in their individual pursuits, Taro says to us that we are in fact free to decide our own essences and meanings. We can escape from the cycle, but we must do so through self-sacrifice, empathy and cooperation. It is precisely Sartre’s self-absorbed and individualistic sentiment that Taro criticizes. The title of the song is “The Weight of the World”. The weight of the world referring to the existential dread and immense responsibility of confronting a godless and ostensibly meaningless word, and finding your meaning, essence and place in it.  </p>
            <p>As the opening quotation insists, however, the question of “whether we’ll have the chance” to kill god and take back meaning for ourselves was never framed as an individual’s question responsibility to shoulder. Having travelled with our player characters for so long, the overseeing assistant droids to 2B, 9S and A2 decide to go against protocol and resurrect them, believing that their experiences together have given them all the courage and enlightenment to overcome their original programming and grasp the meaning to their existences. In the final scene, we see our characters idly resting atop the ruins of humanity and aliens alike. Taro is dead and was killed by our own hands. Humanity is dead to our player characters and have been for a long time. Now, the player and player characters are free to decide for themselves what the point of it all was, and what comes next for ourselves and our player characters. In the final moments of the game, the player is asked if they would like to help another player get through the impossible credits sequence. However, to do so, they must sacrifice their save data. Taro asks us whether we would be willing to help a complete stranger, to recognize their suffering as being like our own and empathize with their predicament. To not be like Sartre and immediately cast down our fellow man who struggles in the face of existential terror. If the game’s message was understood and internalized by the player, their answer will be a resounding yes. </p>
