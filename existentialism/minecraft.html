        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>At first glance Minecraft doesn’t appear like much, it is a very simple game that is popular with people of all ages and is often used in elementary schools as a tool for introducing students to introductory geometry and engineering skills. The basic premise of the game is that the player makes their own meaning. Given a finite set of tools and materials, players can make almost anything. Players have made everything from working computers, using the resource “redstone” which acts as a simple wire to create transistors, and from transistors gates, and from gates logic components, to as is currently in progress a team of thousands of people are recreating the entirety of planet earth in Minecraft using satellite, google images, and brute force.

        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>
        There are no instructions; there are no recommendations, pointers, or quests. There is no winner, no looser, and no set objective. And every time you start a new game the world is entirely different, generated by a psuedo random number that is itself pulled from the entropy of the real world (Modern computers use sources of entropy such as the temperature of your computer, the light level in the room, the size of the data on your drives, etc... to generate random numbers). Sure there are things to do. You can don yourself in diamond armor, find sunken treasure and haunted mansions, trade with natives, explore the dozens of different landscapes, build houses and towns, invite your friends to join you, even complete boss fights. But there is no end to Minecraft. There is no reason to play Minecraft, except for what you make of it. So why is it so popular? 10 years after its beta release Minecraft was the 13th bestselling game of 2019, with 480 million monthly users; making it the highest grossing video game of all time by a massive margin (double 3rd place and triple 4th place).
        </p>
        <p>
        Notice the emphasis in their marketing material of the emphasis on free will. In the absence of a given purpose, players must make their own; l'existence précède l'essence. We can see this is almost the exact principle behind Sartre's ideas of Existencialism.
        </p>
        To make the connection to Sartre even more blunt, the game developers added what has become known as <a href="./theEndPoem.html">"The End Poem"</a> to the game in version 1.0. Upon slaying the Ender Dragon in The End Realm (The closest thing Minecraft had to a final boss when the game was launched). "The End Poem" is framed as a conversation between 2 entities who describe themselves as "The Universe", discussing you, the player. They explain that the world merely is, and that each play through, each life you have in the game is merely a dream. 
        <p>
        <center><q>Sometimes the player read lines of code on a screen. Decoded them into words; decoded words into meaning; decoded meaning into feelings, emotions, theories, ideas, and the player started to breathe faster and deeper and realised it was alive, it was alive, those thousand deaths had not been real, the player was alive</q> (The End Poem)</center>
        </p>
        It is up to the player to turn The Game (which The End Poem uses as an alligory for all of life) into meaning, feelings, and emotion. There is no rule book, no predefined formula for how to play "The Game". 
        <center>There is only "The Game" and how the player plays it.</center>
