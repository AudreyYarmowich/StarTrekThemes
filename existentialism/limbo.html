        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Limbo (2010) is a game that falls into the category of video games as a form of art. The game is a truly immersive side scroller that has a simple plot; A boy wakes up in a forest and searches for his sister. As he continues rightward, the boy encounters a series of increasingly complex puzzles, comprising rope swings and bear traps as well as larger bosses like spiders, which were designed to be failed before being solved. When a puzzle is failed, and the boy is killed, the player simply restarts that puzzle from scratch. However, there is no penalty for being killed, and hence the game poses an important question to the player. The aesthetic of the game is bleak and eerie - the world is built from shades of grey and sounds are minimalistic to immerse the player into its world. In some ways it is very calming, in other ways it seems more like a horror game. In the end, the plot is ended somewhat abruptly, only adding to the mystique of the game and desire of the player to learn more about this world.

        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>
        Limbo has a number of existential themes which relate the game to postmodernism. From the beginning of the game representing “the existential angst,” or the beginning of any conscious being experience, through the simplicity and authenticity of the game representing some of existentialism's best virtues, the game challenges the player to realize his own journey, and how meaningful that truly is. According to existentialists, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called "the existential angst" or a sense of disorientation, confusion, or dread in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world. This is quite similar to the way the game begins, with a boy arising from earth to begin his journey in an absurd reality. The puzzles begin to feel more like tasks as the player moves ever onward to a goal they do not realize, and the player begins to wonder the meaning in continuing onward blindly completing tasks with no consequence for failure. This is a central tenet of existentialism. The player must examine his own existence in comparison with the game.
