      One complicated sci-fi theme Star Trek has never shied away from has been <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Time_travel">time travel</a>. While time travel paradoxes in The Original Series were simple enough, with a simple problem and usually a single choice, the seriousness of time-travel and all the effects it might entail gets emphasized more and more as Star Trek evolved. The Next Generation in many ways still kept this blasé attitude when it came to time travel, but later in the show and into Deep Space Nine and Voyager (especially Voyager), time travel and the altering of timelines is taken far more seriously. While Star Trek has always used the model of a single timeline (alternate universes exist but they aren't the result of time travel, with the exception of the Kelvin Universe, but no one really cares about the Kelvin Universe since those weren't the best movies), and that going back in time can create circular paradoxes. But it isn't until Enterprise and Discovery that Star Trek really begins to play with the long term effects and the truely complicated nature of time. Both Enterprise and Discovery have season long time travel story arcs that have a lot more time to explore how time works.

      Episodes involving time travel in TOS and TNG both take a very objective look at time travel. There is a problem, it creates a time paradox, they solve it and set the timelines back exactly as they would have been. Time travel is only possible via immense god-like beings or hyper-rare space phenomena. Temporal incursions are not the result of human action. And these episodes that do involve time travel ask questions regarding the butterfly effect as in <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_City_on_the_Edge_of_Forever_(episode)">“The City on the Edge of Forever”</a> but the choices are still presented in a binary and the objective is always to put the timelines back, the fact that they are there with the ability to have an effect, isn’t considered an effect on the timelines.

      This idea of correcting the timelines is taken even further with the introduction of the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Temporal_Accord">“Temporal Accords"</a> and <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Temporal_Prime_Directive">Temporal Prime Directive”</a> in <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine">Deep Space Nine</a> and <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek%3A_Voyager">Voyager</a>. While the plots are more complex and the pardoxes more convoluted in both their causes and effects, they are still typically 1 to 2 episode issues. In the episode <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Trials_and_Tribble-ations_(episode)">Trials and Tribble-lations</a>, Star Fleet sends a team of temporal agents to make sure the 22nd century wasn’t messed up during all of <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Benjamin_Sisko">Captain Sisko’s</a> crews interference, while the time travel here is still accidental, its the first time we see a governing body that exists to solve time and to monitor those who affect the past. Voyager takes time travel and the regulation of it to the next level with over half a dozen time travel related episodes each more complicated than the last. As the first Star Trek series that introduces the idea of intentional man-made (or alien made in this case) time travel, Voyager has frequent run ins with Federation Time Ships, like the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/USS_Relativity">USS Relativity</a> from the 29th century (The Doctors mobile holo-immitter is 29th century technology, adapted and used frequently, plainly ignoring the temporal accords), comes across enemies that wield time as a weapon, or future versions of the crew who try to prevent disasters as in <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Timeless_(episode)"> Timeless</a>. The result is a much more nuanced approach to managing the timeline, and a much more serious take on the nature of time itself.

      Finally we get into more modern Star Trek series like Enterprise and Discovery which dedicated entire seasons to single time travel paradoxes allowing them to go much more in-depth. <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek%3A_Enterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a> finds the USS Enterprise in the middle of a temporal cold war where various factions, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Suliban">The Suliban Cabal</a>, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Na%27kuhl">Na’kuhl</a>, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Unnamed_Sphere-Builders">The Sphere Builders</a>, and The Federation (from the 31st century) vie for power attempting to disrupt timelines and remove their enemies from time with massive consequences (in <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Shockwave_(episode)">Shockwave: Part 1</a>, the episode ends with the Federation being removed). Then Discovery season 2 takes revolves the idea of fluid time. The plot of the whole season revolves around chasing beacons around the galaxy. Each beacon leads to an adventure which further unlocks puzzles about what they need to do. In <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Perpetual_Infinity_(episode)">Perpetual Inifinity</a>, we learn that Commander Burnhams mother had been stuck in the future and was conducting experiments regarding the nature of time, this notion of fluid time causes causes the Discovery to realize each beacon is sent by Commander Burnham in the future in order to force Discovery to repeat what it has already done in a time loop paradox. This is the first self perpetuation paradox (Where time travel provides the cause that results in the time travel being necessary in the first place). The Discovery would never have found out about the time travel suit or the threats possed by <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Control">Control</a> without future Burnham leading them to the clues. When the puzzle is all pieced together at the end, Burnham has to go back in time to lay the beacons.
