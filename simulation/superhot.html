        <h2>Super Hot</h2>
        <h3>Or How I Learned to Start Worrying and Distrust the Game</h3>
        <p class="w3-opacity">By James Johnson</p>
        <p>Super Hot: an endless game of quick paced, intense action with a fun mechanic to entice the player to pick it up. However, underneath all of the glamour hides a dark and insidious side of the game. Super Hot becomes a synecdoche for the entire video game industry and tries to rewrite the narrative of how video games relate with their audience.</p>
        <div align="center">

        </div>
        <p>The interface for Super Hot is a lovely, old, text only operating system called piOS. From here, the player interacts with a friend over an instant messaging application. The friend starts raving about a new game he found called Super Hot. Wanting us to play the game, he sends over a file that automatically hacks into a company’s server where the game is hosted. At this point, the player is finally able to get into the game.</p>
        <p>“Time only moves when you move” flashes into the players eyes upon loading into the first level. This is the true gimmick of Super Hot. Having some control over time allows the player to be just like Neo from the Matrix and easily dodge bullets and deftly catch flying objects out of the air as they're dropped by enemies. This new game mechanic is intriguing enough to carry the player through the oddities that purvey the game’s darker message.</p>
        <p>The odd parts of Super Hot first show up after the first set of levels when the game starts to glitch out and the player is thrown back into piOS after seeing “Unauthorized Access” in big red text. This interruption becomes a constant throughout the game. It breaks up the levels and allows for more exposition through the instant messages between the player and their friend. At one point in the game, all of the player’s messages to their friend start getting rewritten by the game as they are sent to the other player. Innocent messages are rewritten to “Sounds like you’re playing too much”, “The game is broken”, and “I don’t think either of us should be playing this”. Are these mysterious messages a genuine attempt to ward the player off from the game or to add mystery around the game to draw the player back in?</p>
        <p>Mystery is only added to the game when the player is led to his own body sitting in a room with a VR headset on. Even more curiously, the own player’s body is colored red which is how the player identifies enemies within the game. The motif of the one’s body being the enemy continues on later in the game when the system the player hacks into keeps repeating 1984 style phrases such as “Bodies are disposable” which leads the player to say “my body is holding me back”. It was this motif that reminded me of this <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywaj4w/world-of-warcraft-changed-video-games-and-wrecked-lives">Vice article</a> about how World of Warcraft destroyed people’s lives as players would spend hundreds of hours every month playing the game. For one player, his body became his enemy as he had to find a way to work around his need for food, sleep, and the bathroom while being able to play World of Warcraft as long as possible.</p>
        <p>Super Hot is a story of how video games are designed to consume players lives with no regard to the health or safety of the players. This theme is plays out as the literal goal of the plot and is complicated by subtleties within the game. The overall plot of the game is for the player to upload their mind to the mainframe on which the game is run so that they are able to play the game forever. In addition, the player kills their own body which releases them from all physically needs that might interfere with their playing of the game. Once the player has successfully uploaded their mind to the mainframe, the game asks the users to start spreading the game to others by specifically calling it “innovative”. This message from the game then throws the earlier messages from the player’s friend as merely a part of the larger cycle of players convincing other players to get into the game.</p>

        <p>Taking Super Hot as a synecdoche for the greater gaming industry, we see that the end goal of game developers is to create a game that spreads itself and creates an unhealthy addiction of the player to the game. The immoral position of the game developers truly shines in the End User License Agreement that flashes past the user’s eyes. The EULA reserves the rights for the game to take such actions as terminate the player, sell their organs, and a prohibition against the player wearing a Zoot Suit. The absolute parody of the EULA brings to light just how different games are from the days of Pong. There is the sense of an antagonistic relationship between the player and the game given the nature of the EULA. The narrative of games having the purpose of entertaining players is changing to games having a sole purpose of profit. All other aspects of the game are just there to serve the purpose of profits.</p>
        <p>The most important message from Super Hot comes in one short segment when the player completely loses control over their interactions with the game. After game asks the player to try to quit the game, the player finds that the escape key no longer functions properly and that they are functionally trapped in the prison cell that the game has placed them in. Presented with the question of “What if we don’t let you?” by the game, the player is left wondering who is actually in control.</p>
        <p>Video games are a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ilkerkoksal/2019/11/08/video-gaming-industry--its-revenue-shift/#52fdc7b5663e">multibillion dollar industry</a> which allows companies to invest in new strategies and methods of making their games more addictive. This continuously takes the control out of the players hands and turns games into a drug like substance. Like the players who lost themselves in World of Warcraft, the game is no longer a game but a fix where players always need to beat one more level, defeat one more boss, take one more second off their time, or get that next achievement. Games are no longer designed so that the player is in control but so that the game can control the player and direct their actions to the company’s benefit. If an addiction once seemed like a lack of self control in a person, it now looks a lot more like a company taking advantage of how games can act so similarly to a drug like heroin or cocaine to keep players coming back for their next fix.</p>
        <p>Super Hot questions the standard narrative of video games as a fun distraction from the quotidian and paints a bleaker picture of what the game industry is trying to achieve. The game doesn’t only change the narrative of common interaction with video games but also explores ideas of how to define reality and self in a world where everything can be simulated by being a virtual reality game. Through its extra materials and hidden content, Super Hot becomes a postmodern exploration of how players and game companies interact with each other.</p>
