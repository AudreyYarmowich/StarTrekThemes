        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Metal Gear Solid 2</i> takes place four years after the events of the first game Metal Gear Solid. Rather than play the titular character Solid Snake, the player plays  as a young soldier codenamed Raiden for nearly the entire game excluding the prologue at the beginning. The main mission Raiden is assigned is to retrieve the president, who is held hostage by a terrorist group named the Sons of Liberty at an environmental cleanup facility. After a run-in with members of Dead Cell, a smaller unit of exceptionally skilled soldiers working under the Sons of Liberty, Raiden runs into the two remaining members of SEAL Team 10, Pilskin and bomb disposal expert Peter Stillman. What initially appears to be a hostage crisis gradually unveils to be a much deeper plot, as Stillman is killed by one of Dead Cell’s bombs and Pilskin reveals himself to be Solid Snake, having been framed for a previous terrorist attack in the prologue of the game. The leader of the Sons of Liberty, Solidus Snake, is the former president of the United States and working alongside him is Revolver Ocelot, the secondary antagonist of the first game.
        </p>
        <p>
         Halfway through the game, the cleanup facility is revealed to be a massive armed fortress housing “GW”, a powerful AI constructed by a secret organization called the “Patriots”, which is designed to control and manipulate the flow of information in the United States. Raiden learns that Solidus Snake had planned to undermine GW, hindering the Patriots’ plans as both an act of revenge and an act towards the cause of the Sons of Liberty. Solid Snake successfully inserts a virus into GW, permanently damaging it and preventing Solidus from completing his goal to attack the Patriots. Revolver Ocelot then reveals himself to be a double-agent for the Patriots, telling Raiden that the Patriots planned the entire crisis at the cleanup facility to train him, and another Patriots AI system assigns Raiden to eventually kill Solidus Snake against his will. The AI explains that it is one of many AI’s the Patriots hold, and their master plan is to be able to “create context” for the public as the digital age of information reshapes the global landscape.

        Raiden successfully kills Solidus Snake, and he teams up with Solid Snake to find and take down the Patriots once and for all.

        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          The game both subtly and blatantly breaks the fourth wall. Whether it’s for comic relief, a nod to players who played the previous titles, or to add a mood of unease and paranoia, Metal Gear Solid 2 weaves between the areas of the game’s world and the player’s. Hideo Kojima and Tomokazu Fukushima’s decision to bend the boundary between the game and the player forces the player to question the power dynamic in playing video games, asking the question of whether the game is playing the player as well. This narrative structure also allows the writers to provide social commentary as the new century propels itself into an age of exponential technological development and overwhelming means of communication globally.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most notable demonstration of the game’s narrative structure is the allusion of itself via Raiden mentioning his VR training prior to the mission. When he tells Solid Snake he’s prepared because of the immense VR training he’s undergone, Snake berates him, telling him the simulated training does not prepare him for the reality of the mission.
