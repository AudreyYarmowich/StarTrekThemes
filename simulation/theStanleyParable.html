        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          This is the story about Stanley. On the surface "The Stanley Parable" is a very simple game. You find yourself in an office, all your co-workers are gone. A narrator comments on how weird this is. The narrator procceeds to narrarate what you are about to do, implying you should do what they say. Following the narrators commands he tells you that Stanley would first check the meeting room, then his managers office. At every step Stanley gains information from the omnipotent narrator telling him where to go, what the code to the secret door is, how to turn off the mind control machine, etc. In total it takes about 10 minutes to follow his instructions. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Occasionally Stanley is presented with choices: A pair of open doors, a set of stairs that go up and down, side paths, etc. As you stray from the path the narrator has laid out for you, his language changes from narrating Stanley's actions to talking directly to Stanley. Sometimes he begs you to return to the story. Other times he scolds you or tries to reason with you. In several paths he recognizes this is a game and tries to make it more fun for you to play. There are dozens of different possible results of taking different paths through the game. Sometimes completing the game in one way will effect the next time you play the game, changing the narration.

        Full Play Through of all of the different possible endings of the Stanley Parable (Indie Games World, April 2, 2016)
        </p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Starting with what I'll call the primary story line (the choice of the player to follow all of the directions of the narrator), the style of game where actions are narrated before they happen is already unsettling. The story this omnipotent narrator leads you through is one of destroying a mind control device. This throws Stanley's entire world into chaos. He was happy with his boring desk job... or was he being mind controlled the whole time? In the end of this story Stanley escapes from the clear simulation into the real world and the narrator leaves him at peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things get a lot more interesting the more play throughs you do. In one combination of choices the narrator assumes your bored with the current game and places Stanley in the middle of <a href="../existentialism/minecraft.html">Minecraft</a> (An interesting choice given its a game that represents existencialism). 
        </p>

        Minecraft in The Stanley Parable, immidiatly after the player is moved to Portal also an interesting choice for its post modern themes
        </p>
        <p>By doing this the narrator proves that the kind of simulation is irrelevant. In any game there are usually set rules that the player can follow. The Stanley Parable throws this on its head. </p>
        <p>Each additional ending where the narrator tries to give Stanley what he wants only continues to prove the mallability of a simulation. In some story lines physics are disrupted. In some endings you get to parts of the game before the narrator had time to build them, or didn't build them because he didn't think you'd get there. It rather reminds me of Q from Star Trek who is just able to bend the rules of reality to whatever he fancies for pleasure at that moment. When there is a god watching your every movement the whole nature of reality goes out the window. 
        </p>
        <p>Is the only reason we take reality at face value because we believe it to be solid, unmalliable. Do we believe in reality because of its set rules; we understand it doesn't change at the whim of a single entity, even if that entity was benevolent.</p>
